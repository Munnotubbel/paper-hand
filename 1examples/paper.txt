With the global population aging, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs),
such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been progressively increasing. However,
effective therapeutic strategies and clinical drugs for these disorders remain
scarce. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound primarily derived from the
herbaceous plant Curcuma longa L., has been proposed as a promising candidate for
ND treatment based on the excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and
neuroprotective properties. Its pharmacological activities encompass scavenging
reactive oxygen species, mitigating toxic protein aggregation and cytotoxicity,
repairing mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibiting excessive neuronal apoptosis.
Compared with synthetic drugs, curcumin demonstrates a more favorable safety
profile with fewer side effects. Nevertheless, its clinical application is substantially
hindered by poor bioavailability, which stems from low aqueous solubility, inefficient
intestinal absorption, and rapid metabolism and systemic elimination. Conventional
administration methods often fail to achieve effective concentrations in vivo. Further
clinical trials are also required to validate the therapeutic efficacy and potential
adverse effects in human subjects. This article systematically reviews the
pathogenesis of NDs and the knowledge on curcumin including pharmacological
effects, neuroprotective mechanisms, functions across specific NDs and advanced
strategies to enhance the bioavailability, with the aim of promoting the development
and clinical translation of curcumin-based therapeutics for NDs.

1 Introduction
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) represent a group of disorders characterized by
progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system, particularly
affecting neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These conditions often arise from a complex
interplay of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors (Zhang W. et al., 2023;

Swaddiwudhipong et al., 2023). The most prevalent NDs include
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease (HD). Typical
symptoms encompass memory loss, cognitive decline, motor
dysfunction and behavioral changes, which vary depending on
the specific disease and affected brain regions. The pathogenesis
involves multiple interconnected mechanisms, including genetic
mutations, protein misfolding and aggregation, oxidative stress,
mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation (Zhao
et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020). NDs are closely related to age, as the
onset risk increases and symptom severity worsens with advancing
age (Sun et al., 2024). Consequently, the global aging of the
population is expected to increase the incidence and prevalence
of NDs, presenting a major challenge for healthcare systems
worldwide (Pichet Binette et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021). Current
therapeutic strategies predominantly focus on symptom
management and slowing disease progression. For instance,
cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists are
widely used for AD, while dopamine replacement therapies
remain the standard for PD (D’Angremont et al., 2023; Liang
et al., 2024). However, these treatments are not curative and only
provide temporary relief. Long-term use may lead to reduced

efficacy and increased adverse effects (Xu et al., 2023). In recent
years, significant advancements has been made in drug
development, with a growing emphasis on targeting the
underlying pathological mechanisms. Key targets include β-
amyloid (Aβ) and tau proteins of AD, α-synuclein (α-syn) of PD
and huntingtin proteins of HD (Ran and Zhu, 2024; Martic, 2022).
Additionally, emerging approaches like gene therapy,
immunotherapies and stem cell-based treatments also hold great
potential, although many are still in clinical trial stages (Sun and
Roy, 2021). The development of more effective interventions and
novel drugs is urgently required to address the multifaceted
challenges posed by NDs.
Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, is primarily
derived from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa L. (turmeric) which
is a perennial herbaceous plant that has been extensively utilized in
traditional medicine and culinary practices (Rafiee et al., 2019). The
synthesis of curcumin has been also investigated to develop optimal
procedures for the rapid acquisition (Ahmed et al., 2017). The
chemical structure is characterized by two aromatic rings linked
by a seven-carbon chain with β-diketone functional groups,
conferring the diverse biological activities (Figure 1). Curcumin
exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties, including
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer and neuroprotective
effects, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for NDs
(Tandon et al., 2020). It can inhibit the aggregation of
pathological proteins, mitigate oxidative stress and suppresses
neuroinflammation. Furthermore, curcumin enhances the
expression of neurotrophic factors and promotes autophagy,
aiding in the clearance of damaged cellular components (Gao
et al., 2020; Namgyal et al., 2021). Despite its prospective
pharmaceutical benefits, the clinical application of curcumin is
hampered by poor bioavailability due to low solubility, structural
instability, rapid metabolism and fast systemic elimination. These
pharmacokinetic challenges prevent it from reaching an effective
concentration in target tissues. To overcome the limitations, some
strategies have been proposed such as the development of curcumin
analogs, nanoparticle-based delivery systems, liposomal
encapsulation and the use of adjuvants like piperine (Olmos-Juste
et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018). It was demonstrated
that curcumin nano-formulations exhibited excellent solubility and
stability, along with antioxidant and enzyme inhibition properties,
as evidenced by molecular docking and simulation studies (Kanwal
et al., 2023). These approaches are of significant potential in
improving the efficacy and feasibility of curcumin in the
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
In light of the increasing interest in natural medicine for the
management of NDs, curcumin has garnered extensive attention as a
highly promising therapeutic agent. Some clinical studies have
explored the neuroprotective effects of curcumin, but their
overall findings remain promising yet inconclusive (Table 1).
Most trials were short-term and involved small sample sizes, with
considerable dosage variability. Particularly noteworthy is the
heterogeneity in therapeutic outcomes among studies targeting
the same neurodegenerative conditions, such as AD. Trials

employing unmodified prototype curcumin preparations showed
negligible differences from placebo controls, primarily due to the
inherently low bioavailability and inadequate systemic absorption.
This review systematically synthesizes the knowledge on curcumin,
including the pharmacological effects, underlying neuroprotective
mechanisms, functions across specific NDs, and cutting-edge
strategies for bioavailability enhancement. Meanwhile, the
limitations of current research and the unresolved issues
requiring further investigation are critically discussed. These
insights will contribute to the advancement of novel drug
development and the translation of curcumin-based therapies
toward clinical practice.

3 Pharmacological effects of curcumin
3.1 Antioxidation
Oxidative stress is a critical factor contributing to the onset and
progression of NDs. It arises from an imbalance between the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body’s
antioxidant defenses (Keeney et al., 2024). ROS, such as
superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, are
byproducts of normal cellular metabolism, particularly
mitochondrial respiration. Under physiological conditions, ROS
levels are tightly regulated by endogenous antioxidant systems,
including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Li et al., 2025). However, excessive
ROS and impaired antioxidant mechanisms will cause oxidative
damage to lipids, proteins, DNA and other cellular components
(Dorszewska et al., 2023). In neurons, oxidative stress disrupts
mitochondrial function, leading to reduced ATP (adenosine
triphosphate) and increased ROS, which forms a vicious cycle of
oxidative damage. Cell homeostasis is thus destroyed, and the
misfolding and aggregation of toxic proteins are exacerbated, like
Aβ in AD and α-syn in PD (Van Laar et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2011).
Oxidative stress induces lipid peroxidation, and impairs the
structural and functional integrity of cell membranes and
organelles. Moreover, the damage to DNA caused by excessive
ROS activates apoptotic pathways to accelerate neuronal cell
death (Al Olayan et al., 2020). The imbalance between ROS and
cellular defense aggravates neuroinflammation by stimulating
microglia and astrocytes to release pro-inflammatory cytokines
(Wang et al., 2021a; Dash et al., 2025). The blood-brain barrier is
also impaired under such conditions, losing the ability to prevent
peripheral immune cells and harmful molecules from infiltrating the
central nervous system (CNS), which thereby accelerates
neurodegeneration (Yang et al., 2024; Kim S. et al., 2024). The
cumulative impact of these processes results in the gradual loss of
neuronal structure and function, manifesting as cognitive decline,
motor impairments and other degenerative symptoms
associated with NDs.
Curcumin exerts the antioxidant effects through multiple
pathways. Firstly, it can directly scavenge ROS and reactive
nitrogen species, thereby reducing oxidative damage to cellular
components (Alisi et al., 2018). It is attributed to the well-
characterized structural motifs (Ahmed et al., 2024). The
chemical structure including two phenolic rings connected by a
β-diketone moiety enables curcumin to neutralize free radicals and
inhibit lipid peroxidation. The activity of endogenous antioxidant
enzymes such as SOD, CAT and GPx is enhanced by curcumin,
which plays a crucial role in detoxifying ROS and maintaining
cellular redox homeostasis (Santana-Martínez et al., 2019). In
addition to the direct antioxidant effects, curcumin can also
regulate the signaling pathways of antioxidant reactions to
protect neurons from damage (Duan et al., 2022). For instance,
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master
regulator of antioxidant responses. Under normal conditions,
Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor, Kelch-like
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). When subjected to oxidative
stress, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to antioxidant
response elements (ARE), inducing the expression of antioxidant
genes (Kang et al., 2024). Curcumin can promote the dissociation of
Nrf2 from Keap1 and enhance its activation to facilitate the
upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and phase II detoxifying
enzymes, which collectively reduce oxidative stress and
strengthen cellular resilience (Rathore et al., 2023). On the other
hand, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that
promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and related
enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, inducible nitric oxide synthase and
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase
(Patel et al., 2017). Cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine peptide-
modified antioxidant nanoparticles were developed for co-
delivery of curcumin (C-PPS/C) to modulate oxidative and
neuroinflammatory disturbances of mice with traumatic brain
injury. It was revealed that C-PPS/C nanoparticles accumulated
at the injury site and broke the “ROS-neuroinflammation” cycle to
protect the blood-brain barrier and promote long-term neurological
recovery. The hydrophobic core of C-PPS/C composed of poly
(propylene sulfide) can react with and scavenge ROS, while
curcumin release further suppressed ROS and inflammation.
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

Meanwhile, C-PPS/C nanoparticles were found to inhibit the NF-κB
pathway to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Fu X.
et al., 2025). Additionally, curcumin’s ability to chelate metal ions
like iron and copper further contributes to the antioxidant effects, as
these metals are known to catalyze the production of highly reactive
hydroxyl radicals through Fenton reactions (Cengiz et al., 2023). For
example, Cd exposure (2.5 mg/kg for 60 days) induced behavioral
impairments in mice through prefrontal cortex cellular
inflammation and oxidative stress, as a result of the reduction of
endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity, and the increase of pro-
inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNFα) and decrease of anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Curcumin treatment
(20–160 mg/kg for 30 days) could mitigate these behavioral and
biochemical impairments by reducing the neuroinflammation and
oxidative damage as well as increasing the number of viable
prefrontal cortex neuronal cells (Namgyal et al., 2021).
3.2 Anti-inflammation
Inflammation is triggered by body’s defense responses to stimuli
such as injury and infection, and is usually conducive to tissue repair
and pathogen clearance. Acute inflammation is always short-term
and beneficial, but the chronic inflammation, caused by persistent
triggering or immune dysregulation, can damage tissues and lead to
neurodegeneration (Zhang W. et al., 2023). Neuroinflammation is
characterized by the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Gulen et al., 2023). Microglia
are resident immune cells in CNS, which perform the functions of
synaptic pruning, damage repair, homeostasis maintenance and cell
phagocytosis. However, facing pathological stimuli such as protein
aggregates, microglia are activated and adopt a pro-inflammatory
phenotype, leading to the release of cytokines involving interleukin-
1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-α) to exacerbate neuronal impairment (Peruzzotti-Jametti
et al., 2024; Nikolopoulos et al., 2023). The activation of
microglia is regulated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),
including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding and
oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), which can
recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Li and Wu,
2021). Astrocytes are another type of glial cells related to
neuroinflammation. In response to inflammatory signals,
astrocytes undergo reactive astrogliosis, accompanied by cellular
hypertrophy and the upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) (Lopez Rodriguez et al., 2021; Linard et al., 2023). Reactive
astrocytes release cytokines and chemokines that further amplify the
inflammatory response and disrupt the blood-brain barrier, allowing
peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the CNS (Ghita et al., 2021;
Qian et al., 2023). The chronic activation of microglia and astrocytes
leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation and
neurodegeneration. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS not
only damage neurons directly but also induce the misfolding and
aggregation of toxic proteins, a hallmark event of NDs. Additionally,
inflammation destroys synaptic plasticity and inhibits the clearance
of harmful substances to further aggravate neuronal dysfunction
(Geng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2014). In summary, the activation of
microglia and astrocytes, and the subsequent release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and ROS, create an unfavorable
environment for neuronal damage and death.
Regulating inflammatory signaling pathways and inhibiting
inflammatory mediators are the main mechanisms of curcumin
to achieve anti-inflammatory effects. By inhibiting the activity of the
inhibitory kappa B kinase (IKK), curcumin prevents the
translocation and activation of NF-κB, thereby reducing the
expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, which ultimately attenuates inflammatory
responses (Jobin et al., 1999). NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)
inflammasome is a protein complex involved in the development of
immune and inflammation-related diseases. Curcumin can directly
restrain the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, or inhibit its
activation by restricting the NF-κB pathway (Cai et al., 2025;
Ruan et al., 2022). T helper 17 cells (Th17), one of the targets of
curcumin, are an important pro-inflammatory cell that secretes IL-
17, IL-22 and IL-23 to promote inflammation responses. On the
contrary, regulatory T cells (Tregs) possess prominent anti-
inflammatory effects. The imbalance of Th17 and Tregs can lead
to an abnormal immune response (Chaudhry et al., 2011).
Curcumin suppresses Th17 differentiation and regulates Treg/
Th17 rebalance by inhibiting IL-23/Th17 pathway to maintain
immune homeostasis. The expression of Th17 cells related
cytokine profiles (IL-17A and RORγt) was dramatically decreased
in curcumin-treated mice, indicating the inhibited differentiation
and development of Th17 cells. Besides, it was demonstrated that
type 4 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR4) was
constitutively expressed in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic
cells (BMDC), and mGluR4 siRNA-transfected BMDC tipped the
balance of T cell differentiation toward the Th17 phenotype.
Curcumin upregulated mGluR4 expression in mouse BMDC,
which likely contributed to the mechanism of inhibiting the
Th17 cell differentiation (Zhao et al., 2017; Rahimi et al., 2019).
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are an pivotal group of
regulatory factors in cellular stress response. Inhibiting the MAPK
pathway is another way for curcumin to reduce the release of
inflammatory mediators and cell apoptosis (Maugeri et al., 2023).
It was recently found that curcumin interacted with the Z1-type
protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor (PTPRZ1) to maintain the
enzymatic activity, thereby regulating the phosphorylation of the
m6A-reader YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2)
and avoiding the overactivation of microglia (Zhang et al., 2025).
This process is beneficial to relieve neuroinflammation, alleviate
brain damage and promote neuronal repair. In addition to the above
strategies, curcumin inhibits inflammation-related transcription
factors by reducing the accumulation of ROS (Chen T. et al.,
2024). Autophagy-related pathways (such as AMPK/mTOR) can
be also activated to promote the clearance of toxic protein aggregates
and damaged cells, so as to avoid inflammation and neuronal
damage (Khayatan et al., 2025; Fu Y. et al., 2025).
3.3 Apoptosis inhibition
Apoptosis, also called programmed cell death, is a highly
regulated process that automatically eliminates damaged or
unnecessary cells to maintain tissue homeostasis (Baar et al.,
2017). Apoptotic cells are characterized by distinct morphological
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

changes, including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA
fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies which are
subsequently phagocytosed by neighboring cells (Arvanitaki et al.,
2024). However, when apoptosis is dysregulated as a result of
oxidative stress, neurotrophic factor deficiency, inflammatory
responses, and protein misfolding and aggregation, it can induce
excessive and premature cell death, thereby contributing to
progressive neuronal loss (Kumari et al., 2023; Norton et al.,
2024). The principal factors of apoptosis program include Apaf-1
(apoptotic protease-activating factor 1), Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma-2)
family proteins and caspases (cysteinyl aspartate-specific
proteinases) (Qin et al., 1999). The Bcl-2 family, comprising both
anti-apoptotic proteins (like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) and pro-apoptotic
proteins (like Bax and Bak), governs apoptosis primarily by
modulating mitochondrial permeability. Under normal
physiological conditions, anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2
and Bcl-xl, form homodimers or multimers on the mitochondrial
outer membrane to maintain its integrity and inhibit cytochrome c
release. In contrast, pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak predominantly exist
as inactive monomers (Edlich et al., 2011). Upon exposure to
apoptotic stimuli, Bax and Bak undergo conformational changes,
become activated, and insert into the mitochondrial membrane,
which then heightens mitochondrial permeability and facilitates the
release of cytochrome c (Antonsson et al., 1997). The released
cytochrome c subsequently binds to Apaf-1 to generate the
apoptosome that recruits and activates caspase-9 as well as
downstream effector caspases (like caspase-3/caspase-6),
ultimately executing cell death (Kim et al., 2005; Li et al., 1997).
Bcl-2 can interact with Bax to form heterodimers, thereby
suppressing Bax activity and cytochrome c release to block the
subsequent apoptotic cascade. Excessive accumulation of toxic
proteins induces endoplasmic reticulum stress to disrupt calcium
homeostasis, activating the apoptotic pathway (Lim et al., 2023).
Additionally, neurofibrillary tangles formed by
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins reduce their binding affinity
with neuronal tubulin, destabilizing microtubules and promoting
neurodegeneration (Savastano et al., 2021; McMillan et al., 2023). By
secreting Il-1α, TNF and complement component subunit 1q, the
activated microglia induce the formation of neurotoxic reactive
astrocytes which lose the ability to support neuronal survival,
outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, leading to the death
of neurons and oligodendrocytes (Zhang L. et al., 2023).
Furthermore, reduced levels of neurotrophic factors, such as
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), diminish the
initiation of anti-apoptotic process, rendering neurons more
vulnerable to apoptosis (Zhang K. et al., 2023).
Curcumin, on the one hand, scavenges ROS to improve
neuronal microenvironment and prevent apoptosis; on the other
hand, it promotes microglial polarization toward an M2 phenotype
and inhibits M1 polarization, thereby suppressing inflammation-
induced apoptosis and fostering neuronal regeneration (Qian et al.,
2024; Chen Z. et al., 2024). The expression of pro-apoptotic proteins
Caspase 3/8/9, Bax and apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 is
reduced by curcumin while that of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 is
increased. Endoplasmic reticulum stress is mitigated by curcumin-
mediated downregulation of Grp78 (glucose-regulated protein 78)
and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) expression. This effect is
likely attributed to curcumin’s ability to upregulate CAT and
glutathione reductase levels, thereby enhancing cellular
antioxidant capacity. The resulting reduction in ROS
overproduction helps preserve the functional integrity of
mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and II (Wu et al.,
2024). The combination of curcumin and vagus nerve stimulation
was found to significantly lower the neurological deficits, infract
volume, neural apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines release. The
phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK2 were both increased after
the combination therapy (Xu et al., 2018). Mitochondrial damage
and dysfunction are key factors of neuron loss. Curcumin protects
mitochondrial respiratory chain by maintaining the stability of
membrane potential. At the same time, mitochondrial
dysfunction is ameliorated via promoting mitochondrial
biogenesis to inhibit abnormal neuronal apoptosis (Zheng et al.,
2023). Excessive autophagy can lead to metabolic stress and
degradation of cellular components, which exacerbates the
structural destruction and functional decline of tissues (Aman
et al., 2021). It was indicated that curcumin significantly reduced
the level of H
2
O
2
-induced autophagy with a decreased expression of
autophagy marker proteins LC3-II and Beclin-1. The ERK1/
2 signaling pathway was also inactivated by inhibiting
phosphorylation, thereby reducing autophagy responses and
protecting nerve cells from oxidative stress (Ruan et al., 2024).
Curcumin (200 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated brain injury and
neurological deficits in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery
occlusion by upregulating autophagy-related proteins p-Akt and
p-mTOR, while downregulating autophagy-associated proteins
LC3-II/LC3-I and inflammation-related proteins IL-1, TLR4, p-38
and p-p38. However, these protective effects were attenuated when
either LY294002 (a specific inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway) or anisomycin (an activator of the TLR4/p38/MAPK
pathway) was administered. It was suggested that curcumin
exhibited neuroprotective effects by modulating autophagic
activities via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and
simultaneously suppressing inflammatory responses through
regulation of the TLR4/p38/MAPK pathway (Huang et al., 2018).
In summary, the excessive loss of neurons is avoided by curcumin
through multiple mechanisms to prevent progressive
neurodegeneration.
3.4 Metal chelation
Metal ions are widely present in biological systems and
participate in many key biochemical processes including material
transport, energy conversion, information transmission and
metabolic regulation (Chen et al., 2022; Maniscalchi et al., 2024).
Common ions, like zinc (Zn
2+
), magnesium (Mg
2+
), iron (Fe
2+
/Fe
3+
)
and copper (Cu
2+
), are co-factors of a variety of enzymes which play
an important role in stabilizing enzyme conformation, transferring
electrons, and connecting enzymes and substrates in enzymatic
reactions (Valdez et al., 2014). They are indispensable in human
bodies. However, the imbalance of metal ions, whether deficiency or
excess, can lead to metabolic disorders, cell and tissue damage,
weakened immunity and neurological dysfunction (Tian et al.,
2024). The accumulation of metal ions promotes the production
of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical through Fenton and
Haber-Weiss reactions, resulting in lipid peroxidation of cell
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

membrane (von Krusenstiern et al., 2023). Cellular integrity is
damaged by the oxidative damage of lipids, proteins and DNA
(Khan et al., 2020). Metal ion imbalance and oxidative stress trigger
the overproduction of Aβ by activating β- or γ-secretases and
inhibiting α-secretase, and also cause tau hyperphosphorylation
by activating protein kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase-
3β (GSK-3β), cyclin-dependent protein kinase-5 and MAPKs, and
inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (Wang et al., 2020). It has been
found that both essential (Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn) and nonessential (Pb,
Al and Cd) metals can accumulate in the brain and activate
microglia and astrocytes to release pro-inflammatory factors
(Domingo-Relloso et al., 2024). The inflammation and oxidative
stress intensify each other, forming a vicious cycle. In addition, metal
ion imbalance interferes with the electron transport chain in
mitochondria, leading to the loss of membrane potential and
energy metabolism disorders. The corresponding decrease in
ATP production eventually leads to cell apoptosis (Shen et al.,
2023). Calcium ions (Ca
2+
) are indispensable to physiological
activities, which participate in the signal transduction,
neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion. Excessive metal
ions impair Ca
2+
channels and calmodulin function, generating
abnormally elevated intracellular calcium concentrations. The
breakdown of calcium homeostasis affects the synthesis, release
and reuptake of neurotransmitters, followed by excitotoxicity and
loss of neurons (Fan et al., 2020; Bharat et al., 2023).
Ferroptosis and cuproptosis are two specific modes of cell death
that depend on the exposure to iron and copper, respectively (Zou
et al., 2020; Li S. et al., 2022). The ferroptosis is characterized by iron
metabolism disorder, ROS accumulation, reduced glutathione levels
and the inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). The
presence of Fe
2+
and lipoxygenases facilitates the lipid
peroxidation of cell membranes and ultimately induces
ferroptosis (Qiu et al., 2024). Both exogenous and endogenous
pathways drive this process. Exogenous pathways rely on the
inhibition of system Xc– (cystine/glutamate transporter) and the
activation of the transferrin and transferrin receptor 1, while the
endogenous pathway mainly involves blocking the activation of
GPX4 (Xue et al., 2023). As for cuproptosis, it is closely related to
mitochondrial metabolism. The excess copper binds to lipase in the
mitochondrial TCA cycle, which accelerates protein aggregation and
proteotoxic stress, leading to cell death (Chen et al., 2022). It has
been proved that changes of iron and copper homeostasis is directly
linked to the progression of multiple NDs, including AD, HD and
ALS (Maniscalchi et al., 2024).
The metal chelation of curcumin is mainly attributed to the unique
chemical structure, including two adjacent phenolic hydroxyl groups
and a β-diketone moiety, which enable it to form stable complexes with
various metal ions through coordination covalent bonds (Mari et al.,
2022). The oxygen atoms in phenolic hydroxyl groups provide lone pair
electrons to interact with positively charged metal ions, and the
carbonyl oxygen atoms in the β-diketone structure further enhance
the stability of metal-curcumin complexes by providing additional
coordination sites for metal ions (Moradi et al., 2020). The metal-
chelating ability is affected by many factors, especially the pH. Under
acidic conditions, the phenol hydroxyl groups are more readily
protonated, thereby increasing the affinity to metal ions (Wahyudi
et al., 2022; Rasouli and Ghavami, 2021). Neuroprotective effects are
exerted by modulating the activity of metal-dependent enzymes,
reducing the production of ROS, and inhibiting the aggregation of
abnormal proteins. The chelating effect of curcumin reduces the levels
of free metal ions and inhibits their participation in the reactions of free
radical generation, which helps protect neurons from oxidative stress-
induced cell death (Namgyal et al., 2021). Additionally, the aggregation
of toxic proteins is also reduced, slowing the progression of
neurodegeneration. The binding of cadmium or arsenic to SOD
diminishes its enzymatic activity, whereas curcumin forms hydrogen
bonds with histidine residues, thereby reducing SOD’s affinity for
arsenic and cadmium and restoring its activity (Cengiz et al., 2023).
Cerebral cortex acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine deaminase
(ADA) activities were elevated in rats exposed to Cd (2.5 mg/kg). Co-
treatment with curcumin reversed these enzyme activities back to
control levels. Furthermore, Cd exposure induced an increase in
lipid peroxidation in the cerebral cortex, accompanied by a
reduction in functional sulfhydryl (-SH) groups and nitric oxide
(NO), a critical neurotransmitter and neuromodulatory agent. Co-
administration of curcumin (12.5 or 25 mg/kg) enhanced the non-
enzymatic antioxidant status and NO levels while simultaneously
reducing malondialdehyde levels. Therefore, the inhibition of AChE
and ADA activities, along with the enhancement of the antioxidant
status mediated by curcumin, may provide potential mechanisms
underlying its cognitive-enhancing effects in Cd-induced memory
dysfunction (Akinyemi et al., 2017). Curcumin can also improve the
cell apoptosis caused by metal toxicity. Excessive accumulation of heavy
metals promoted the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and
caspase-3, suppressed Bcl-2 expression, and induced the release of
cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases
from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Curcumin inhibited both early
and late apoptosis induced by heavy metals and reversed the alterations
in apoptotic markers. Metallothionein (MT), a cysteine-rich protein,
plays a pivotal role in metal detoxification. Curcumin increased the level
of MT2A mRNA and enhanced the expression of MT2. The
antiapoptotic effects of curcumin were attenuated under MT2A
knockdown conditions, suggesting that MT2A may be a critical
target of curcumin (Wahyudi et al., 2022). Aluminum is known as a
neurotoxic metal, which may show negative effects on the nervous
system, particularly at higher concentrations (Bishop et al., 1997). The
symptoms include movement disorders, seizures, memory loss, learning
disabilities and depressive tendencies. Curcumin has the potential of
reducing the bonding affinity of Al
3+
to DNA and preventing the Al
3+
-
induced cognitive impairment (Sood et al., 2012). It can be concluded
the metal-chelating ability of curcumin, driven by its unique chemical
structure, plays a crucial role in neuroprotection by modulating enzyme
activity, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, inhibiting toxic
protein aggregation, and alleviating metal-induced apoptosis, thereby
offering a promising therapeutic strategy for NDs.
4 Function of curcumin in the
treatment of specific NDs
4.1 Alzheimer’s disease
4.1.1 Pathogenesis of AD
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder that accounts for 60%–80% of all dementia cases
worldwide. The main manifestations are behavioral changes and
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

gradual decline of cognitive functions, which seriously affect daily
life (Self and Holtzman, 2023). It is estimated that over 50 million
people are currently living with AD, and this number is projected to
rise to 152 million by 2050 (Long and Holtzman, 2019). The
prevalence of AD increases with age. Approximately 5%–10% of
individuals over 65 years old and more than 20% of those over
85 years old are affected. With the aging of global population, AD
has become a major public health challenge (Pichet Binette et al.,
2020). Hallmark pathological features of AD are the accumulation of
Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (Islam et al., 2025). Aβ plaques
are formed due to the abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor
protein by β- and γ-secretases that leads to the production and
aggregation of toxic peptides in brain. The plaques disrupt neuronal
communication and trigger inflammatory responses (Pang et al.,
2022). Tau, on the other hand, is a structural protein mainly
distributed in CNS, which is responsible for maintaining the
stability of microtubules, like the “skeleton of neurons”. It
facilitates the efficient transport of nutrients to support the
optimal exercise of physiological functions (Roemer-Cassiano
et al., 2025). However, in AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated
to detach from microtubules and form toxic neurofibrillary tangles
that impair cellular transport and accelerate neuronal death (Berlind
et al., 2025). The upregulation of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7)
induces AD-like tau pathologies by deacetylating the transcriptional
factor EB (TFEB) and inhibiting lysosomal biogenesis in astrocytes.
Suppressing HDAC7-TFEB signaling is promising for alleviating
AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (Ye et al., 2025). The
recent findings also suggested that Aβ promoted tau spreading in
AD by eliciting neuronal hyperactivity and hyperconnectivity
(Roemer-Cassiano et al., 2025). These pathological changes
primarily affect the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which are
critical regions for memory and cognitive functions.
Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation driven by activated
microglia and astrocytes, mitochondrial dysfunction and genetic
variation are all key factors in the development of AD (Long and
Holtzman, 2019). It has been found that mutations in the amyloid
protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2
(PSEN2) genes are associated with autosomal dominant early-onset
familial AD, while apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) represents the most
significant genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD,
contributing to the deposition of Aβ peptides and
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (Giau et al., 2019; Rao et al.,
2025). Accumulating evidence has unveiled the bidirectional
communication between gut microbiome and CNS, referred to as
the “microbiota-gut-brain axis” (Forner et al., 2021; Wang X. et al.,
2019; Boehme et al., 2021). The gut microbiome regulates microglial
maturation and activation via short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
release. The depletion of SCFAs stimulates the transition of cells
towards a pro-inflammatory state. The elevated immune activation
is coupled with impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission, and
cholinergic gamma oscillations (Loh et al., 2024). Akkermansia
muciniphila, a mucin- and SCFA-yielding intestinal
microorganism, is essential for the regulation of metabolic
homeostasis and immune system, and propionic acid is one of
the main metabolites. It was revealed that propionate reduced
mitochondrial over-division by downregulating mitochondrial
fission protein (DRP1) via G-protein coupled receptor 41, and
activated PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy via GPR43 to
maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and improve the
pathological injury of AD (Wang Z. et al., 2025).
4.1.2 Function of curcumin in AD
The strategies of curcumin to address AD mainly include the
inhibition of Aβ aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation, anti-
oxidation, anti-inflammation and brain-gut axis regulation (Pei
et al., 2024; Ruan et al., 2024). Curcumin directly binds to small
Aβ peptides to block the aggregation and fibril formation, which
attenuates their destructive effect on cell membranes, thereby
reducing cytotoxicity and improving cell survival (Chen Z. et al.,
2024; Zhang et al., 2010). Moreover, curcumin facilitates the
clearance of Aβ by enhancing microglial phagocytic activity and
up-regulating Aβ-degrading enzymes. Neprilysin (NEP) is the most
important Aβ-degrading enzyme. Its expression decreases with age
and is negatively correlated with Aβ accumulation (Iwata et al., 2001;
Kim et al., 2023). The investigation of 25 curcumin analogs
surprisingly showed that dihydroxylated curcumin,
monohydroxylated demethoxycurcumin, and mono- and di-
hydroxylated bisdemethoxycurcumin, increased NEP activity, but
curcumin did not. Thus, it was proposed that
polyhydroxycurcuminoids might be better candidates than
curcumin as a dietary supplement in the prevention and therapy
of AD (Chen et al., 2016). Exposing organotypic hippocampal
cultures to Aβ, curcumin and/or LY294002, it was found that
curcumin treatment mitigated the Aβ-induced decline in
synaptophysin expression, and significantly reduced cell death.
Aβ resulted in the increase of phosphorylated (Ser45) β-catenin
and the decrease of β-catenin immunocontent, but curcumin
prevented this destabilization. Additionally, the neuroprotective
effects of curcumin was inhibited by LY294002, and the
phosphorylation/activation of Akt and the phosphorylation/
inactivation of GSK-3β were activated, which revealed that the
neuroprotection may involve the PI3-K pathway and β-catenin
signaling, a key transduction factor of Wnt signaling pathway
(Hoppe et al., 2011). Metabolomic studies of other natural
compounds, have similarly identified hippocampal and cortical
metabolic pathways critical for counteracting Aβ-induced
neurotoxicity, reinforcing the potential of phytochemicals in
multi-target AD therapies (Li H. et al, 2022). On the other hand,
curcumin inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in
neurons and microglia to relieve neuroinflammation and reduce
the amyloid plaque burden in AD (Guglielmo et al., 2017; Ruan
et al., 2022). Molecular docking indicated that there were putative
binding sites with curcumin in microtubule-binding regions of tau.
It could not only inhibit the oligomerization of tau, but also
disintegrate preformed tau filaments (Rane et al., 2017). The
curcumin-primed exosomes effi
ciently penetrate blood-brain
barrier through receptor-mediated transcytosis to access brain
tissues, and inhibit tau phosphorylation by activating the AKT/
GSK-3β pathway, which holds great potential in improving targeted
drug delivery and restoring neuronal function (Wang H. et al.,
2019). In the initial stage of AD, copper accumulation triggers a self-
assembly of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Tian et al., 2024). Under
inflammatory conditions, high levels of copper in serum can also
induce oxidative stress and promote inflammatory response. The
difluoroboron curcumin derivative (DF-Cur) showed highly specific
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

and selective recognition of Cu
2+
, which could serve as a diagnostic
agent for the copper detection. Additionally, DF-Cur promoted the
excretion of Cu
2+
and reduced its accumulation in vivo, alleviating
the damage to nervous system (Wang M. et al., 2021). It was
demonstrated that curcumin functioned as prebiotics, which
adjusted the gut microbiota community, improved intestinal
barrier integrity, and prevented the release of detrimental
metabolites and pro-inflammatory factors. Considering the link
between gut health and neurodegeneration, the treatments
targeting gut microbiota may be a promising strategy to address
neuroinflammation and delay AD (Kim Y. et al., 2024; Su
J. et al., 2021).
Although curcumin has demonstrated promising anti-AD
activity in cellular and murine models, consistent clinical
evidence remains lacking. In a clinical trial involving 36 patients
with mild-to-moderate AD, no significant differences were observed
between oral curcumin (2 or 4 g/day) and placebo after 24 weeks of
treatment (Ringman et al., 2012). Pretty low native curcumin
(7.32 ng/mL) was measured in the plasma. Gastrointestinal
adverse effects were reported in five participants from the
intervention group. Conversely, a separate six-month randomized
controlled trial revealed that a curcumin-galactomannan complex
(400 mg twice daily) significantly improved Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale
(GLFS) scores of AD patients compared to both placebo and
unformulated standard curcumin, suggesting a potential delay in
disease progression (Das et al., 2023). This formulation positively
modulated serum levels of AD-specific biomarkers, including
BDNF, Aβ42, tau protein, IL-6 and TNF-α. Notably, no adverse
effects were reported in either the curcumin or placebo groups in
this trial. These findings highlight that the clinical efficacy of
curcumin may depend on formulation type, dosage and
bioavailability. Further large-scale, long-term studies are
warranted to conclusively establish its therapeutic effects and
safety profile in AD populations.
4.2 Parkinson’s disease
4.2.1 Pathogenesis of PD
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent
neurodegenerative disorder after AD, mainly manifested as motor
dysfunction and cognitive decline. Globally, more than 10 million
individuals currently suffer from PD, with a prevalence rate of 1%–
2% among those over 65 years old (Bloem et al., 2021; Ben-Shlomo
et al., 2024). PD can be categorized into two distinct subtypes,
familial (genetic) PD and sporadic PD, based on the etiological
origins. Familial PD results from well-defined pathogenic mutations
in associated genes (like SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN, PINK1 and DJ-1).
These mutations exhibit autosomal dominant or recessive
inheritance patterns and can be transmitted across generations,
often leading to multiple affected individuals within families. As
for sporadic PD which accounts for approximately 90% of cases, it
lacks clear familial aggregation. The pathogenesis involves complex
interactions between environmental exposure, lifestyle and age. The
primary pathogenesis of PD involves the degeneration and death of
dopaminergic neurons in midbrain substantia nigra, as well as the
presence of abundant filamentous inclusions of α-syn in the form of
Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (Yang et al., 2022; Mahul-Mellier
et al., 2020). As a widely expressed protein in CNS, α-syn normally
plays a role in neuronal signal transduction and synaptic function.
However, in PD, α-syn monomers undergo misfolding and
aggregate into fibrous structures that transfer between neurons
and rapidly spread throughout brain regions, causing functional
damage and neuronal death (Hallacli et al., 2022). Toxic proteins
infiltrating the midbrain substantia nigra can trigger the demise of
dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor symptoms such as
bradykinesia, resting tremor, and muscle rigidity. When they
disseminate to the cerebral cortex, cognitive deficits like memory
decline, anxiety and somnipathy may emerge (Park et al., 2025).
FAM171A2 is a key regulatory gene of progranulin, a secreted
pleiotropic glycoprotein associated with NDs (Xu W. et al., 2020).
The expression of FAM171A2 was found to be significantly elevated
in PD and positively correlated with the aggregation of α-syn. The
domain 1 of FAM171A2 protein is tightly bound to the C-terminal
region of α-syn by electrostatic interaction, and the binding degree
of FAM171A2 to pathological α-syn fibers is much stronger than
that of monomeric α-syn. Their combination enhances the
endocytosis of neurons, encouraging toxic proteins to enter the
cells (Wu et al., 2025). The endosomal sorting complex required for
transport (ESCRT) system is responsible for the sorting, trafficking
and degradation of proteins and other cellular components. It is
critical in facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn through
the endosome pathway (Nim et al., 2023). The E3 ubiquitin ligase
Listerin promotes K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing
it to the endosome for the subsequent degradation. It has been
revealed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates α
-syn-
induced olfactory dysfunction and motor deficits in a mouse model
of PD (Qin et al., 2025). Parthanatos-associated apoptosis-inducing
factor nuclease (PAAN), also known as macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF), is a critical member of the PD-D/E(X)K
nuclease family that serves as a terminal executor in the parthanatos
pathway (Wang et al., 2016). Neurodegeneration is triggered by
pathological α-syn through the nuclease activity of PAAN/MIF.
Both genetic ablation of PAAN/MIF and the nuclease-deficient
mutant have been demonstrated to protect against dopaminergic
neuron loss and mitigate behavioral impairments in the α-syn
preformed fibril mouse model of sporadic PD (Park et al., 2022).
Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone
modifications and non-coding RNA regulation, play significant roles
in modulating dopamine transporter (DAT) endocytosis, a process
implicated in PD pathogenesis (Liang et al., 2025). While no direct
epigenetic regulator of DAT endocytosis has been identified, DNA
methyltransferases can indirectly affect this process by altering the
expression of genes involved in key signaling pathways, such as
protein kinase C and D2 receptor systems (Cremona et al., 2011; Su
and Liu, 2017). Similarly, RNA-modifying enzymes, particularly
m6A methyltransferases, influence DAT endocytosis by regulating
the synthesis and functionality of associated proteins (Jiang et al.,
2021). Histone-modifying enzymes contribute to this regulatory
network by controlling chromatin accessibility, thereby affecting
the expression of genes critical for endocytosis, endosome formation
and recycling process (Wang H. et al., 2021). Collectively, these
epigenetic modifications establish a sophisticated regulatory
network that indirectly controls the dynamics of DAT
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

endocytosis and recycling, representing a crucial regulatory node in
neurotransmitter transport and PD progression.
Genetic variation, including single nucleotide variants, small
indels, structural variants, copy number variants and short tandem
repeats, is another important cause of PD, which is associated with
about 10% of cases (Wang C. et al., 2024; Hop et al., 2024). For
example, the variant of LRRK2 is a risk factor for PD in Chinese and
Korean populations, corresponding to SNCA and MAPT genes in
Europeans and GBA1 in Africans (Rizig et al., 2023). SNCA is
responsible for encoding α-syn. Its mutation can cause the
overexpression and aggregation of α-syn, resulting in the
formation of Lewy bodies. The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
(LRRK2) is a multifunctional protein that coordinates a variety
of cellular processes, including vesicle transport, autophagy,
lysosomal degradation, neurotransmission and mitochondrial
activity (Zhu et al., 2023; Deniston et al., 2020). Gain-of-function
mutations of LRRK2 gene trigger lysosomal dysfunction and
abnormal cellular response to membrane damage, leading to
vesicular transport dysfunction, neuroinflammation, accumulation
of alpha-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction and ciliary loss,
ultimately leading to PD (Gustavsson et al., 2024; Simuni et al.,
2020). In addition to the above factors, the identified mechanisms of
PD also include oxidative stress, ferroptosis, gut dysbiosis and so on.
Their interaction complicates the disease and poses great challenges
to clinical treatment and drug development (Dong-Chen et al., 2023;
Kotsiliti, 2023).
4.2.2 Function of curcumin in PD
Up to now, the research on curcumin in the treatment of PD has
been mainly conducted at the molecular level and in mouse models.
There is still a lack of large-scale human experiments and convincing
clinical evidence. Curcumin mitigates neuronal degeneration by
blocking the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-NLRP3 signaling
pathway to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated
inflammatory responses and counteracts α-syn-induced
neurotoxicity (Cai et al., 2025). At the molecular level, curcumin
dose-dependently reduces intracellular ROS, inhibits mitochondrial
membrane potential collapse and cytochrome c release, and
suppresses caspase-9/caspase-3 activation, thereby interrupting
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (Liu et al., 2011).
Additionally, by inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun
N-terminal kinase, curcumin prevents the mitochondrial
translocation of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax, subsequently
reducing dopaminergic neuronal death and striatal axonal
degeneration (Pan et al., 2012). The coordination polymers,
composed of ferric ions and curcumin at an ultrasmall nanoscale,
exhibit blood-brain barrier permeability, which can effectively
scavenge free radicals, inhibit neuroinflammation and restore
mitochondrial function. These polymers significantly alleviate
oxidative stress and inflammatory states in the midbrain and
striatum (Cheng et al., 2022). In animal models, curcumin
treatment (80 mg/kg) reversed rotenone (2.5 mg/kg)-induced
motor coordination deficits while restoring antioxidant capacity
and mitochondrial function. The rotenone-induced PD model
displayed compromised autophagy, characterized by reduced
p62 and LC3-II expression levels which led to excessive
accumulation of misfolded α-syn. In contrast, curcumin
promoted the autophagic clearance of pathological α-syn by
upregulating LC3-II expression and inhibiting the apoptotic
cascade. Furthermore, curcumin administration upregulated
Nrf2 expression and normalized the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway,
thereby enhancing antioxidant activity (Rathore et al., 2023). The
curcumin analogue-derived nanoscavenger (NanoCA) with a
controlled-release property was designed to facilitate the nuclear
translocation of TFEB, which activated both autophagy and
calcium-dependent exosome secretion to clear α-syn. Pre-
treatment with NanoCA has been shown to shield cell lines and
primary neurons from MPP
+
-induced neurotoxicity. Significantly, a
novel rapid arousal intranasal delivery system (RA-IDDS) was
developed to ensure targeted delivery of NanoCA to the brain,
which provided substantial neuroprotection to alleviate behavioral
deficits and enhance the clearance of monomers, oligomers and
aggregates of α-syn in the midbrain (Liu et al., 2020). Emerging
evidence suggests that the activation of the gut-brain axis through
intestinal inflammation may contribute to PD pathogenesis, with
gastrointestinal dysfunction representing the most common non-
motor symptom (Kotsiliti, 2023). In the N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model, curcumin
intervention attenuated the reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase levels
in both substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum, inhibited
AIM2-mediated pyroptosis and caspase-1 activation, and
decreased pro-inflammatory factors and inflammatory responses
in the intestinal tract. The gastrointestinal disorders and barrier
function were improved, and motor dysfunction and dopaminergic
neuron loss were reversed (Zhong et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2023). These
findings highlight curcumin’s potential as a multi-target therapeutic
agent in PD, addressing both central and peripheral mechanisms of
the disease.
4.3 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
4.3.1 Pathogenesis of ALS
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is pathologically defined by
the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons followed
by muscle denervation, atrophy and ultimately profound motor
disability. The annual incidence is 1.5–2.7 per 100,000 individuals,
with a corresponding prevalence of 3-5 per 100,000 (Xu L. et al.,
2020). The peak period of disease onset is between 55 and 65 years
old. Approximately 10% of ALS patients are hereditary, called
familial ALS (fALS), while the remaining 90% (sALS) occur
sporadically without apparent genetic predisposition (Van Daele
et al., 2023). Notably, the mean onset age of fALS tends to be earlier
than that of sALS. Cognitive impairments occur in 20%–50% of
cases, with a subset (5%–15%) progressing to full-blown
frontotemporal dementia. The average survival time ranges from
2 to 5 years post-diagnosis, and respiratory failure is the primary
cause of mortality. About 5%–10% of individuals exhibit
significantly prolonged survival exceeding 10 years (Su W. et al.,
2021). The exact pathogenic mechanisms of ALS have not been fully
elucidated. Potential risk factors include genetic predisposition,
neurotoxicant exposure (organic solvents, pesticides and heavy
metals), chronic nutritional deficiencies, metabolic disorders,
immune dysregulation, viral infections and neuroinflammation
(Newell et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2022). The widely accepted
hypothesis proposes that motor neuron degeneration arises from
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental
factors, primarily through mitochondrial dysfunction and
cytoskeletal disruption mediated by oxidative stress and
excitotoxicity (Zhou et al., 2023). The neurodegenerative cascade
typically originates at the neuromuscular junction and distal axons,
characterized by early synaptic dysfunction and axonal degeneration
that progresses to neuronal death, ultimately causing neural
transmission failure and motor impairment (Berth and Lloyd,
2023). Axonal lesions are the earliest clinical symptom and
crucial cause of ALS (Luan et al., 2024). Among the ALS-
associated genes, multiple mutations have been demonstrated to
be strongly correlated with axonal dysfunction (Mizielinska et al.,
2025). The highly efficient transport system within neuronal axons is
essential for maintaining material and energy supply, and transport
defects constitutes a major contributor to ALS. Kinesin, a motor
protein responsible for anterograde transport of organelles, vesicles,
and protein complexes from the cell body to synaptic terminals,
causes transport disruption when mutated. Conversely, the dynein
mediates retrograde transport of various cargoes, and ALS-related
mutations lead to transport abnormalities, axonal swelling and
ultimately motor neuron degeneration (Cristofani et al., 2017).
Additionally, the change of tubulin can destabilize microtubule
networks, which also impairs axonal transport (Fumagalli
et al., 2021).
The abnormal accumulation of proteins in motor neurons is a
hallmark pathological feature of ALS, mainly including transactive
response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), fused in sarcoma (FUS),
SOD1 and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1). RNA-binding proteins,
particularly TDP-43, play a key role in protein aggregation. TDP-
43 aggregates are found in over 90% of ALS cases (Lepine et al., 2022).
Most disease-causing mutations in these proteins occur in low-
complexity domains mediating liquid-liquid phase separation to
alter protein conformation, which promotes the aggregation and
disrupts RNA regulation while also generating additional toxicity.
Notably, many protein aggregates also present in neuronal axons,
such as mutated TDP-43 and FUS, resulting in abnormal RNA
transport and dysregulated protein synthesis (Marrone et al.,
2019). SOD1 was the first identified ALS-associated gene, and
mutations alter the protein conformation to expose hydrophobic
surfaces and facilitate the aggregation (Wang L. et al., 2024).
C9ORF72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) is another core
genetic contributor to ALS. The expansion of a G4C2 (GGGGCC)
hexanucleotide repeat in the non-coding region leads to the
production and accumulation of dipeptide repeat proteins in
neurons (Maor-Nof et al., 2021). In addition, SOD1, C9ORF72,
TDP-43 and FUS are also crucial molecular players associated with
mitochondrial defects in ALS. The SOD1 G93A mutation results in its
accumulation within axons and significantly impedes mitochondrial
trafficking. Furthermore, SOD1 G93A may form pathogenic
complexes with Bcl-2 to potentiate cytochrome c release and
subsequent activation of apoptotic pathways (Pedrini et al., 2010).
Other SOD1 mutants, including A4V, H46R, D90A and R115G, have
been also found to disrupt proteostasis, diminish mitochondrial
membrane potential and compromise ATP generation (Rasouli
et al., 2018). The poly-dipeptides derived from
C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansions exhibit high affinity for
mitochondrial proteins, thereby impairing mitochondrial structural
integrity and intracellular transport dynamics, as well as Ca
2+
uptake
and ATP synthesis (Fumagalli et al., 2021). Pathogenic mutations in
TDP-43, like Q331K and M337V, interfere with the microtubule-
dependent mitochondrial transport system, leading to profound
mitochondrial dysfunction. Excessive TDP-43 can also induce
mitochondrial DNA leakage into the cytosol, which activates NF-
κB and type I interferon pathways that drive neuroinflammatory
responses (Yu et al., 2020). In summary, aberrant protein changes are
crucial of ALS. Nevertheless, the distinct aggregation behaviors
underscore the multifaceted nature of the pathology and present
formidable challenges for therapeutic development.
4.3.2 Function of curcumin in ALS
Curcumin is recommended as a dietary supplement to reduce
the risk of ALS (D’Antona et al., 2021). However, to date, research
on its therapeutic potential in ALS remains limited (de Oliveira et al.,
2016). Both mutant and wild-type TDP-43 elevate neuronal
excitability, with mutant TDP-43 exhibiting greater toxicity. The
hyperexcitability is accompanied by oxidative stress and
mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment with dimethoxy curcumin
(DMC) significantly normalizes aberrant action potentials and
voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel activity, indicating a
dropping-excitability state. The rescue involves DMC-mediated
mitigation of oxidative stress and restoration of mitochondrial
function (Dong et al., 2014). Men and postmenopausal women
show a higher incidence and more severe progression of ALS and
FTLD (frontotemporal lobar degeneration) compared to younger
women, pointing to a key role for sex hormones in disease
development (McCombe and Henderson, 2010). In Prp-TDP-
43
A315T
mice, dysregulated expression of estrogen-related enzymes
(CYP19A1 and CYP3A4) was observed relative to wild-type
controls, which suggested that toxic phosphorylated TDP-43
oligomers may disrupt the balance between CYP19A1 and
CYP3A4 expression, resulting in reduced estrogen biosynthesis
and accelerated degradation. Remarkably, oral administration of
solid lipid curcumin particles (SLCP) improved survival in female
Prp-TDP-43
A315T
mice and diminished pathological TDP-43
deposits. The treatment also mitigated TDP-43-driven
neurodegeneration by regulating estrogen production and
CYP450 enzyme activity. These findings highlight SLCP as a
potential estrogen replacement therapy for ALS and FTLD
(Majumder et al., 2025). Curcumin shows enhanced binding
affinity for mutant proteins compared to the native form,
primarily through increased hydrophobic interactions (Srinivasan
and Rajasekaran, 2016). By targeting amyloidogenic regions,
curcumin blocks SOD1 fibrillation and promotes the formation
of smaller and disordered aggregates. While pre-fibrillar and fibrillar
SOD1 aggregates exhibit significant toxicity, this effect is absent in
curcumin-treated samples, suggesting its ability to neutralize
harmful intermediates (Bhatia et al., 2015). Additionally,
curcumin potently inhibits FUS liquid-liquid phase separation by
suppresses droplet formation and stress granule assembly. Based on
hydrophobic interactions, it reduces FUS β-sheet content, mitigates
aberrant aggregation, and rescues cellular metabolic dysfunction by
reversing FUS-induced sequestration of pyruvate kinase and
restoring ATP production. (Shi et al., 2023). These properties
position curcumin as a promising candidate for ALS, but further
investigation is still warranted to fully elucidate its efficacy and
mechanism of action.

4.4 Huntington’s disease
4.4.1 Pathogenesis of HD
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor
dysfunction, cognitive decline and psychiatric disturbances, which
typically manifests in mid-adulthood with an average age of
30–50 years old (Ling et al., 2025; Eddy et al., 2016). It has been
reported across diverse ethnic populations, with the highest
prevalence observed in Caucasian populations (10.6–13.7/
100,000). In contrast, Asian populations including those in Japan,
Taiwan (China) and Hong Kong (China) demonstrate substantially
lower prevalence (0.1–0.7/100,000), suggesting potential genetic
and/or environmental modifying factors (Wise, 2010; Buchanan
et al., 2023). The disease is invariably fatal, with a life expectancy of
15–20 years after symptom onset. The neuropathological features of
HD are selective and massive degeneration of medium spiny
neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, and mild degeneration of
cortical pyramidal neurons, accompanied by astrocyte
proliferation (Wright et al., 2020). It arises from an abnormally
expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat encoding the elongated
polyglutamine (polyQ) within exon 1 of Huntingtin (HTT) gene,
which results in the production of toxic mutant huntingtin proteins
(mHTT) that accumulate in neurons, particularly in the striatum
and cortex (Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease Consortium,
2019). In healthy individuals, the HTT gene normally contains 10 to
35 CAG trinucleotide repeats, while HD patients exhibit more than
36 repeats. Emerging evidence indicates that pronounced neurotoxic
effects manifest only when CAG repeats exceed 150 copies. These
exceptionally large repeat expansions demonstrate striking cellular
specificity, being predominantly localized to MSNs (Matlik et al.,
2024). Upon exceeding 150 CAG repeats, MSNs undergo
progressive loss of neuronal characteristics while concurrently
upregulating senescence-related and pro-apoptotic gene
programs, culminating in neuronal degeneration. Notably, MSNs
maintain stable gene expression profiles when CAG repeat lengths
remain below the critical threshold (Handsaker et al., 2025). Longer
CAG repeats are correlated significantly with earlier onset age and
more severe clinical manifestations (Genetic Modifiers of
Huntington’s Disease Consortium, 2019).
Genome-wide association studies have identified potential
genetic modifiers, including mismatch-repair (MMR) genes
(MSH3, MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2) and other DNA repair genes
(FAN1 and LIG1) (Aldous et al., 2024). The MMR system comprises
specialized protein complexes with distinct functions: MutSβ
(MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) primarily recognizes large insertion-
deletion loops (IDLs) and repetitive sequence extrusions, whereas
MutSα (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) detects smaller 1-2 bp IDLs
(Ferguson et al., 2024). Following mismatch recognition, MutS
complexes recruit specific MutL heterodimers including MutLα
(MLH1-PMS2), MutLβ (MLH1-PMS1) and MutLγ (MLH1-
MLH3) (Dai et al., 2021; Ortega et al., 2021). While MutLα and
MutLγ possess critical endonuclease activities essential for MMR
initiation, the biological role of MutLβ remains enigmatic due to
the lack of demonstrated nuclease activity. The knockout of MMR
genes (MSH3, PMS1, MSH2 and MLH1) ameliorates both early-
onset phenotypes in MSNs and late-onset manifestations in
cortical neurons, including somatic CAG-repeat expansion,
transcriptionopathy and mHTT aggregation (Moss et al., 2017).
MSH3 deficiency specifically improves open-chromatin
dysregulation in neurons. The rapid linear expansion rate of
CAG repeats in MSNs is sharply reduced or terminated by MMR
mutants. The deficiencies in either MSH3 or PMS1 effectively
prevent mHTT aggregation by maintaining somatic CAG repeat
lengths below the critical threshold of 150 repeats (Wang N. et al.,
2025). Moreover, MSH3 deficiency demonstrates comprehensive
therapeutic potential by correcting synaptic dysfunction, astrocytic
abnormalities and locomotor deficits in HD mice (Bunting et al.,
2025). These findings establish that MSH3 and PMS1 play pivotal
roles in driving accelerated somatic mHTT CAG expansion rates
specifically in HD-vulnerable neurons, underlying the repeat length-
dependent, threshold-sensitive, selective and progressive
pathogenesis in vivo.
TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein essential for splicing
regulation. TDP-43 and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) writer
protein METTL3 are upstream regulators of exon skipping in
HD (Mendel et al., 2018). TDP-43 exhibits disrupted nuclear
localization and accumulates in the cytoplasm in a
phosphorylated form in HD mouse and human brains. Notably,
TDP-43 co-localizes with mHTT nuclear aggregates, suggesting a
potential interaction within pathological inclusion bodies (Sanchez
et al., 2021). The binding of TDP-43 to RNAs encoding HD-
associated genes, many of which are differentially expressed and
aberrantly spliced, is significantly reduced. Concurrently, m6A RNA
modifications are diminished on RNAs that are abnormally
expressed in the striatum, particularly at clustered sites near
TDP-43 binding regions (Yu et al., 2018). The spatial and
functional overlap between reduced m6A marks and impaired
TDP-43-RNA interactions suggests a synergistic mechanism: the
loss of METTL3-mediated m6A modifi
cation may destabilize RNA-
protein complexes, exacerbating the inability of TDP-43 to regulate
splicing fidelity (Tollervey et al., 2011). These findings support TDP-
43 dysfunction and altered m6A modification converge to drive
alternative splicing defects in HD (Nguyen et al., 2025). It has been
also unveiled that the adenosine can be methylated to N
1
-
methyladenosine (m1A) by the enzyme TRMT61A, while m1A
can be demethylated by ALKBH3. The m1A/adenosine ratio in
CAG repeat RNA exhibits a positive correlation with repeat length, a
phenomenon attributed to the reduced expression of
ALKBH3 elicited by the repeat RNA. TDP-43 binds directly and
with high affinity to m1A in RNA, which promotes the cytoplasmic
mis-localization and subsequent formation of gel-like aggregates
(Sun et al., 2023).
4.4.2 Function of curcumin in HD
Although multiple cellular events, including oxidative stress,
mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and transcriptional
dysregulation, have been identified in HD, the development of
effective therapies with favorable safety profiles remains an
unmet medical need (Elifani et al., 2016). Curcumin
demonstrated potent anti-aggregation effects in yeast,
significantly inhibiting the formation of both htt72Q-GFP (a
polyglutamine-rich protein) and Het-s-GFP (a non-polyglutamine
protein) aggregates. It was found that curcumin prevented htt72Q-
GFP aggregation through the downregulation of Vps36, a crucial
component of the ESCRT-II complex. On the other hand, it also
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

exhibited disaggregation activity, effectively disrupting pre-formed
htt72Q-GFP aggregates (Verma et al., 2012). Curcumin treatment
enhances mitochondrial function by upregulating the activity of
electron transport chain complexes and elevating cytochrome levels.
This restoration is accompanied by increased glutathione content
and SOD activity, indicating improved redox homeostasis.
Furthermore, curcumin administration significantly attenuates
mitochondrial swelling, reduces lipid peroxidation and protein
carbonyl formation, and decreases ROS production in HD rats
(Sandhir et al., 2014). These protective effects are mediated partly
through the activation of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, leading to
marked improvements in neuromotor coordination (Santana-
Martínez et al., 2019). The CAG140 knock-in (KI) mouse model
exhibits abnormal mHTT aggregates, striatal transcriptional deficits,
and early-onset motor, cognitive and affective impairments.
Curcumin-supplemented KI mice showed reduced mHTT
aggregation and upregulated mRNA expression of striatal
DARPP-32 and dopamine receptor D1, which were accompanied
by behavioral recovery, particularly in rearing deficits (Hickey et al.,
2012). Curcumin enhanced the phagocytic activity by upregulating
the expression of key phagocytic receptors in HD flies, while
simultaneously suppressing the transcriptional expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and anti-microbial peptides (Dhankhar
et al., 2023). It was found that curcumin normalized body weight
and restored lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis. The treatment also
reduced elevated ROS levels in adipose tissue and significantly
improved both survival rates and locomotor function, even at
advanced disease stages (Aditi et al., 2022). A recent study
elucidated the mechanism of curcumin modulating the
aggregation of huntingtin exon 1. Under substoichiometric
amounts, curcumin was found to perturb primary and/or
secondary nucleation events, thereby extending the lag phase
preceding aggregation. Notably, this disruption of the aggregation
kinetics not only altered the structural properties of the resulting
aggregates but also their cellular metabolic profiles. When applied to
neuronal cells, the “break-through” aggregates, formed in the
presence of curcumin, induced markedly lower cellular stress
compared to those generated without the inhibitor. It was
believed that the differential effect was attributed to structural
modifications, particularly the presence or absence of the
polyglutamine (polyQ) β-hairpin conformation in the aggregates
(Jain et al., 2025).
5 Strategies to enhance the
bioavailability and pharmacological
efficacy of curcumin
5.1 Poor bioavailability of curcumin
Although curcumin has demonstrated excellent
pharmacological activities, the extremely low bioavailability
significantly restricts its clinical application in disease prevention
and treatment. After a single oral dose of 10 or 12 g of curcumin for
0.25–72 h, almost no free form is detectable in human plasma
(Vareed et al., 2008). Achieving health-promoting effects often
requires long-term intake of high doses of curcumin, which may
lead to adverse reactions and poor compliance. The low
bioavailability is attributed to multiple factors, including poor
solubility, low stability, inefficient absorption and rapid
metabolism and excretion (Sabet et al., 2021). Curcumin exhibits
poor stability in aqueous solutions and degrades rapidly in a pH-
dependent manner. Its half-life ranges from approximately
100–200 min at pH 3–6.5, but sharply decreases to 1–9 min at
pH 7.2–8.0. Notably, the biological activity of the hydrolysis
products is generally lower or negligible. The primary absorption
site of curcumin in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the small
intestine (Luo et al., 2022). As a lipophilic polyphenolic compound,
curcumin is difficult to be absorbed by small intestinal epithelial
cells. Even when absorbed, its hydrophobic nature often leads to
efflux back into the intestinal lumen via the P-glycoprotein
transporter, which is highly expressed in the intestine
(Culbertson and Liao, 2025). This process significantly reduces
curcumin’s entry into the bloodstream. Following oral
administration, curcumin undergoes rapid metabolism, including
reduction (Phase I metabolism) and conjugation (Phase II
metabolism) in GIT and liver. Enzymes like NADPH reductase
metabolize curcumin into various products, including
dihydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcumin and
octahydrocurcumin (Metzler et al., 2013). Additionally, gut
bacteria, like Escherichia coli, can catalyze curcumin reduction
through a unique bacterial enzyme, CurA (NADPH-dependent
curcumin/dihydrocurcumin reductase), resulting in the
production of dihydrocurcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin
(Hassaninasab et al., 2011). The two phenolic groups of
curcumin also make it susceptible to Phase II detoxifying
enzymes, such as glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases,
leading to the formation of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates
(Pan et al., 1999). These metabolites possess significantly reduced
biological activity compared to curcumin itself. Conventional tablet
or powder formulations release curcumin quickly in the GIT but fail
to address the poor solubility and metabolic challenges. Non-oral
routes, such as intravenous injection, can bypass some of these
issues; however, curcumin tends to aggregate or precipitate in the
bloodstream, raising safety concerns. Therefore, improving
curcumin’s bioavailability remains a critical challenge for its
therapeutic potential.
5.2 Nano-delivery systems
To overcome the above limitations, several strategies have been
developed to enhance the utilization efficiency and pharmacological
efficacy of curcumin, focusing on nanoparticle formulations,
chemical modification, novel delivery systems and drug
combination. Particle size is closely related to drug solubility.
Nanoparticle-based formulations, including nanoemulsions,
micelles, liposomes and solid dispersions, are widely used to
improve curcumin’s solubility and bioavailability (Xu et al., 2024;
Olmos-Juste et al., 2021). Through non-covalent interactions,
curcumin (Cur) and poly (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (pEGCG)
were co-encapsulated within hyaluronic acid (HA) to form HA-
CurNPs nanoparticles that exhibited sustained-release properties
(Chen T. et al., 2024). The released drugs synergistically scavenged
ROS and inhibited apoptosis while modulating CD74 to promote
microglial polarization toward the M2 phenotype, thereby
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14
Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1625821

alleviating neuroinflammation and enhancing neurogenesis.
Additionally, these nanoparticles effectively maintained neuronal
integrity, reduced glial scarring, and ultimately restored electrical
signaling and motor functions at injury sites. To overcome the
blood-brain barrier, curcumin-loaded polysorbate 80-modified
cerasome nanoparticles (CPC NPs, ~110 nm) were developed,
coupled with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction
(UTMD) to enhance brain targeting (Zhang et al., 2018). The
nanohybrid cerasomes demonstrated superior stability against
surfactant solubilization and extended circulation time. The
combined CPC NPs-UTMD approach achieved 1.7-fold greater
brain permeation compared to CPC alone at 6 h post-
administration. In MPTP-induced PD models, this strategy
effectively delivered curcumin to the striatum, clearing α-syn
aggregates and restoring normal motor function, dopamine levels
and tyrosine hydroxylase expression. This novel delivery system
with higher therapeutic relevance and fewer unwanted
complications could be a promising choice for PD treatment.
Liposomes, composed of phospholipid bilayers, can encapsulate
curcumin, enhancing its hydrophilicity and mimicking cell
membranes to promote transmembrane absorption (Fernandes
et al., 2021). PEGylation of liposomes further reduces the
clearance of the reticuloendothelial system and prolongs systemic
circulation. Solid dispersions, such as those prepared with
polyvinylpyrrolidone or poloxamer, increased curcumin’s
solubility and stability by converting crystalline forms into
amorphous structures (Yang et al., 2023). However, low
encapsulation efficiency, complex preparation processes and
instability persist as challenges in nanoparticle-based systems.
5.3 Chemical structure modification
Chemical structure modification, including synthesizing analogs
and designing prodrugs, is another effective approach. Curcumin
predominantly exists in the bis-keto form in acidic to neutral
conditions (pH 3–7), stabilized by an acidic proton on the
activated interaromatic carbon. Conversely, under alkaline
conditions (pH > 8), the enolic form becomes predominant,
conferring electron-donating properties (Genchi et al., 2024). The
β-diketone moiety, responsible for keto-enol tautomerism, can be
modified to enhance its antioxidant activity. 3,5-bis(2-
fluorobenzylidene)piperidin-4-one (EF24) demonstrated potent
NF-κB suppression by directly inhibiting IKK (Kasinski et al.,
2008). EF24 blocked TNF-α-induced IκB phosphorylation and
degradation, with in vitro studies confirming the inhibition of
IKK catalytic activity. These findings identified IKK as the
molecular target of EF24 and elucidated its superior efficacy
compared to curcumin prototype. Prodrugs are
pharmacologically inactive derivatives that are metabolized into
active forms within the body. Common modifications involve
esterification, etherification, hydrazone and disulfide bond
formation. For example, curcumin linked to glutaric acid via an
ester bond showed improved water solubility, while curcumin
conjugated with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) enabled controlled
release, enhancing cellular uptake (Muangnoi et al., 2018; Sampath
et al., 2014). In addition, co-loading curcumin with doxorubicin in
pH-sensitive nanoparticles has demonstrated enhanced
bioavailability and reduced systemic toxicity (Zhang et al., 2016).
Some prodrugs require specific enzymes or endogenous compounds
for hydrolysis, such as the carboxylesterases including
acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and arylesterase that
are critically involved in the bioconversion of ester-based
prodrugs into pharmacologically active forms (Liederer and
Borchardt, 2006). Due to the substrate specificity of different
esterases, the enzymatic consideration should be systematically
incorporated into the early design stage.
5.4 Combination drug therapy
Combination therapies aim to improve curcumin bioavailability
by inhibiting its inactivation and metabolism. Curcumin is primarily
metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and
sulfotransferases. Natural compounds such as piperine, quercetin
and silymarin have been shown to inhibit curcumin
glucuronidation, thereby increasing its plasma levels and oral
bioavailability (Grill et al., 2014; Rinwa and Kumar, 2013).
Synergistic effects have also been observed when curcumin is
combined with other bioactive compounds-naringenin, genistein
and epigallocatechin gallate (Ghobadi and Asoodeh, 2023). For the
rats administered either curcumin (25 or 50 mg/kg) or a
combination of curcumin (25 mg/kg) with piperine (2.5 mg/kg)
once daily for 21 consecutive days prior to 3-Nitropropionic acid
administration (3-NP, a neurotoxin inducing symptoms of
Huntington’s disease), it was found that both curcumin
monotherapy and the curcumin-piperine combination
demonstrated protective effects against 3-NP-induced motor
deficit, biochemical alterations and neurochemical abnormalities.
The combination treatment showed greater neuroprotection
compared to curcumin alone, suggesting piperine as a
bioavailability enhancer of curcumin (Singh et al., 2015). In the
clinical trial involving 48 AD patients, there was no remarkable
differences between the unformulated standard curcumin treatment
and the placebo group. However, the curcumin-galactomannan
complex significantly improved the MMSE and GLFS scores of
the participants as well as the serum levels of specific biomarkers
(Das et al., 2023).
6 Conclusion and prospect
6.1 Conclusion
Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant threat to
public health, exacerbated by the global aging population. The
pathogenesis of NDs, such as AD, PD, HD and ALS, is complex
and multifactorial, involving oxidative stress, neuroinflammation,
mitochondrial dysfunction and protein misfolding/aggregation.
These pathological processes lead to progressive neuronal loss
and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Curcumin, a natural
polyphenolic compound, has emerged as a promising therapeutic
candidate for NDs due to its excellent biological properties,
including potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic
and neuroprotective effects. It has been shown to scavenge ROS,
inhibit pro-inflammatory pathways, reduce the accumulation and

toxicity of misfolded proteins, and promote neuronal survival and
regeneration. To overcome the limitations of curcumin’s low
bioavailability in clinical applications, various strategies have also
been developed to enhance the utilization efficiency and
pharmacological efficacy, including nano-delivery systems,
chemical modifications and combination therapies. In vitro
experiments and a small number of clinical studies have
confirmed the role of curcumin-related preparations in alleviating
neurodegeneration and delaying disease progression. This approach
is considered an additional option for managing the health issues
arising from the global demographic shift toward an aging
population.
6.2 Future prospect
Although curcumin has demonstrated potential neuroprotective
effects, it is important to highlight that the clinical transformation
still encounters numerous challenges and requires further
investigation: (1) Most curcumin formulations used in current
studies are complex mixtures primarily consisting of curcumin,
demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Moreover,
significant variations exist across studies regarding the source,
purity, and formulation of curcumin, complicating the
comparison of clinical outcomes. To address this issue,
standardized quality control protocols for curcumin preparations
should be established to minimize batch-to-batch inconsistencies.
(2) Clinical evidence remains inconsistent, with some trials
reporting limited efficacy, potentially due to inadequate dosing,
suboptimal trial design (e.g., insufficient sample size or duration),
or patient heterogeneity. Additionally, high doses may induce
gastrointestinal discomfort, and the potential hepatorenal toxicity
necessitates further evaluation. Large-scale and long-term clinical
trials are essential to resolve these concerns. (3) While curcumin
exhibits a broad spectrum of molecular targets, its pleiotropic effects
complicate the elucidation of precise mechanisms of action, thereby
hindering targeted therapeutic applications. (4) Despite various
strategies proposed to enhance curcumin’s bioavailability and
therapeutic efficacy, the in vitro-in vivo correlation of cell
cytotoxicity and bioavailability remains poorly understood,
warranting additional human studies. (5) A comprehensive
assessment of the safety, stability and long-term effects of
excipients and polymers utilized in novel delivery systems is
required. Current in vitro and animal models inadequately
replicate the complexity of human gastrointestinal absorption,
limiting their predictive value for drug behavior in humans.
Further research into pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
optimal delivery strategies is necessary for successful clinical
application. (6) Integrating curcumin with complementary
therapies, such as lifestyle modifications, dietary interventions
and physical activity, holds promise for improving outcomes in
NDs. Incorporating curcumin into comprehensive treatment
regimens could potentially slow ND progression and enhance life
quality, addressing the growing global health challenge.
